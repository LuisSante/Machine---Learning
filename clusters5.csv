There are other qr code readers that only need the camera  but they don't work with Google Authenticator. Google needs to build in a QR code reader or use something else more reputable.

com.google.android.apps.authenticator2,Backup problem. People think that the 2 factor authentication codes are linked to the Google account so when you sign in from another device all the 2 factor codes appear but that's not the case. One needs to be rooted to make a backup with titanium backup and restore to the new Android device in order to get the 2 factor codes on a new smart phone or tablet. I hope Google is working on a better way to move the codes to a new device. One can lock the app with an app locker application to prevent people from seeing the code,November 26 2016,4,0

It has numerous shortcomings  however. The user interface is poor -- account names and the timer animation are too small to see comfortably. There is no PIN  which could have been used to store the secret keys encrypted. If somebody steals your phone  they can extract all the secrets from the phone's flash memory. There is no way to back up secrets or transfer them to a second device. Even though I use Google Authenticator all the time  I do so only because there is no good equivalent and trustworthy replacement.,January 23 2017,3,0

You do not need to install a 3rd-party barcode reader to make this app work because there is an option to confirm your device by just manually typing a code. 2. After installing this app  there are still other ways to get into your account if you lose your phone. Overall I'll agree with others that it's not a fancy app  but if you just want a basic number-generating app  then this should meet your needs.,August 24 2016,4,0

com.google.android.apps.authenticator2,With no explanation  the app has removed my account from the phone.

com.google.android.apps.authenticator2,i'd like to think that an easier way could be worked out  but the app does work as described. How many steps there are to complete the setup would be good information up front. For me  the first two codes too about 10 minutes to arrive. since I was expecting them immediately  I did the 3rd one  which worked. The one issue that I have is how to get to the message then back to the screen where it should be entered. I did it  but it was quite clumsy. It would be great if the code could show itself on the page that's already there. There are a couple of weak spots in either my understanding of how it's done or the coder's planning  but this is a well working app.,January 20 2016,4,1

com.google.android.apps.authenticator2,"Authy is much much better than this google authenticator  i can't believe this that its an official app from the team of google who is the tech giant in the world  and saying that """"""""""""""""We respect our customers privacy and we will protect it at any cost"""""""""""""""". Ohh plz come on  you have made an app whoes work is to only show the tokens code but what about its privacy...?? No inbuilt security mechanism  no backups the biggest of biggest disadvantages  atleat AUTHY gives that feature of backup so that if someone changes or upgrade his/her phone than he/she can very very easily restore all the saved accounts which were there in the previous devices. I hope google the tech giant firm will look into this matter and gives the features which not only i'm telling about this things but the millions of users are saying same the same story.

com.google.android.apps.authenticator2,Can't Migrate App Accounts to a New Phone! As a Google partner we use & sell Google products & advise our clients all the time to use the native apps for the best experience. We use the Google Authenticator App to lock down accounts for ourselves & our clients and I have 30 or so accounts configured. I purchased a new phone and being a Google fan I purchased the Nexus 6P. Everything just works after I login to Google except I find out I can't migrate the accounts in the Authenticator App and have to go and set them all up again. This needs fixing!,September 03 2016,1,1

com.google.android.apps.authenticator2,Ye I get it 2 factor auth is supposed to be bound to a specific device. But no backup feature means you are seriously boned if anything happens. Get Authy or Auth Plus  anything but this. Or if rooted you could use Titanium (or manually backup the App settings) but why  just why? Which brings me to another point. On a rooted device this PoS is absolutely NOT secure. The settings are not encrypted at all  they basically assume your phone is secure which Google obviously knows isn't always true  not to mention that they have no control over that. Well done Google  wanna be secure when its inconvenient for the user but too lazy to encrypt what you are trying to protect.,August 22 2016,2,1

com.google.android.apps.authenticator2,This is the worst app i have ever seen If you protect your account with this app then you can't delete the app because your account will be lost and there will be nothing you could do about it. So i lost my Ubisoft account that was worth 200$ great job Google,April 07 2017,1,2
com.google.android.apps.authenticator2,Really angry at this. So my phone needed to be reset. It was crashing every two seconds. I reset it. I imagined since it was a Google App that my accounts and authenticator was syncing to Google so if I reinstalled everything would be there including the programs I was using 2-step for. I reinstalled and all is gone and a couple of programs I used cannot be recovered and are asking me to create a new account. This is upsetting. Going back to 2-step with phone. Find that to be superior since if I lose my phone I will still be able to recover my account by transferring the number.,October 26 2016,1,2
com.google.android.apps.authenticator2,Fix This App I use this for Runescape and now it does comply and I don't wanna get hacked plz fix it,March 12 2016,1,2
com.google.android.apps.authenticator2,It's a great app  but only problem is it does not synchronized applications that you have installed through bar code for easy retrieval. Once you loose the company app code you have a hard time retrieving it especially when you need the code also to gain access to the account on the third-party website and no proper support is provided to disable two-way authentication. example: I can't access my teamviewer anymore because I reinstalled google authenticator and it's asking for code which I can't get on the site without providing security code from Google authenticator. Would be great to have an authenticator that remembers the apps scanned and retrieve it once you provide your google account credentials.,April 21 2017,3,2

com.google.android.apps.authenticator2,The app itself is great  having the same issue others have had with changing phones. My old phone broke  and I got a replacement phone (still using the SIM card from my old phone) and I still can't link my accounts. I was able to re-connect my google account (because of the text option) but nothing else. If you are on the same google account  with the same phone number as before  you should be able to sync with the other accounts you had on the authenticator. I had 2-step verification with my bank account  and now I can't log in because it needs a code. But the only way for me to get codes in the app on the new phone is to re-add the bank account  which I can't do because I need to be logged in to my online banking in order to generate a barcode or key.

com.google.android.apps.authenticator2,Had to try codes over 20 times to even set up the google authenticator account Its an interesting idea to keep accounts safe but it doesn't work properly. I had to enter a code to set up my google authenticator account over 20 freaking times and it just wouldn't take the code  and when these codes are timed  it gets overly frustraiting and stupid. I tried each and every code with a a space too since it wasn't accepting the codes without one either. It FINALLY decided to work after 10-15 minutes of trying and alot of anger and frustration. So like I said  its an interesting idea for account security...... WHEN IT DECIDES TO WORK! Hopefully  you fix this problem before I'm forced to use this app for verification purposes again cause if it pisses me off like it did the first time  its bye bye app and hello new app that actually works properly! NOT IMPRESSED OR HAPPY ABOUT THAT. At this point  I would NOT recommend this app to my friends.,December 31 2016,2,2

If you have been diligent and turned on two factor auth on all your important accounts  you are going to be punished. If your device is lost or broken  you may never recover your accounts.

Google has to have your phone number  and be able to track you at all times or you can't use their stuff.

Their support staff kept insisting that using this crap is the best way to protect my account and now that I have access back into my account I should re activate this 2 step process using this APP. So I took their advice and although I had gone through and changed my password about 5 times that day the hackers could still access my account because of this APP  I tried to deactivate all other devices to no avail they could still gain access even after password changes  deactivation of this app being used for access to my account and then reactivation.

com.google.android.apps.authenticator2,Great app to add that extra layer of protection to your Google accounts like Gmail. To many complaints & bad ratings based on the apps UI  who really cares about the UI  as long as it does it's job & it does do it's job perfectly.

com.google.android.apps.authenticator2,Very handy  with one fatal side effect The app's code stores were wiped without my authorization. I have not reset or wiped my phone  only typical app and device updates applied. I'm unsure as to why the information was wiped  but it has set back my ability to access accounts that utilize these 2FA codes. I don't know when this occurred  only that today the app seemed to act as if I had just installed is. As in  it asked for camera permissions.,November 23 2016,2,4

com.google.android.apps.authenticator2,Migration option removed Authenticator used to have a 'migrate to new phone' option  so if you had to change phones  you could easily take all the 2fa accounts to the new one. Piece of cake. Now that option was quietly removed in early 2016  with no explanation. Now you can do it by removing and re-adding all the accounts one by one. Madness. Avoid.,December 13 2016,1,4
